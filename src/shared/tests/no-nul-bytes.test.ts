/**
 * No file this package ships contains a RAW NUL byte.
 *
 * **A ONE-BYTE, INVISIBLE, SINGLE-ENGINE OUTAGE - AND THIS PACKAGE SHIPPED ONE.** `react/shared/
 * mdx.ts` joined its cache key on a literal NUL instead of the escape, and it went out in a
 * published release: the editor renders the byte as nothing, the diff renders it as nothing, `tsc`
 * accepted it, the whole suite stayed green, and Chrome ran it perfectly - V8 tolerates a raw NUL
 * inside a string literal. SpiderMonkey does not: its tokenizer treats NUL as END OF INPUT, so the
 * enclosing string is "not terminated before end of script" and the module never parses. Firefox
 * reports that with no file, no line and no module.
 *
 * A LIBRARY is the worst place for it. Consumers bundle this source, and a bundler's dev output
 * wraps each module in `eval()` - so the failure surfaces in somebody else's app, in one engine, as
 * a blank page, and nothing in their stack points back here.
 *
 * **A NUL DELIMITER IS FINE - WRITE IT AS `\u0000`.** This is not a ban on the character: the MDX
 * cache key uses one deliberately, because neither an options signature nor MDX source can contain
 * it. The escape produces the identical character, so every key built from one is unchanged, while
 * staying visible in an editor, a diff and a review. What this bans is the raw byte on disk.
 *
 * `dist/` is scanned too when it is present: it is the artefact that actually reaches consumers, and
 * a stale build carrying the byte is exactly as fatal as the source would be.
